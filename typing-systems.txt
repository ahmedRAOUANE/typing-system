    ## typography
    the text in this system are does not need a tag to define it, but there some things needs to be defined like heading

    ### heading
    in this system the heading words "titles", are defined with the # tag, # means h1 in html witch is the biggest on ## means h2 untill we stop ##### h5 witch is the samllest opens

    ### links
    the links in this system are defined by -> if you want to put only the url, you can use "alt word"-> the link here if you want to display the alt word insted of the url
    "" the words between the doble coutes are the alternative word that displayed instead of the full url
    -> the text after this sign treats as url

    as an example: 
    "google"->https://www.google.com this is a link lead's to google home page, the word you see is google

    ## Upcomming features
    ### notes and comments
    @note and @comment these tow tags are hiding the content inside from the displayed content in Docs page 
    the deffrent between them that the @note tag saves the noted section and still can display it of the reader clicked the note button 
    but the @comment you will still can see it in the preview while you udating you concept and the reader cannot be able to see it 

    for example
    @note starts
        this paragrapgh will be noted, the reader can see it when clicking on the note button, and the writer can see it on the preview directly

        you can note other sections tow
        as an example
        @example starts
            this is an example section inside the note section, and not only the exanple tage, you can use what ever you want
        @example ends
    @note ends

    @comment starts
        this is a comment special section, the reader is not able to see it, it's for the writer to use, he still be able to it while he writing or updating his concept

        the same thing as note tag he can use other section inside the comment special section
    @comment ends

    the @note and @comment tags are the only special sections that can be used with no closing tag, it can be used with other section to comment or note them 

    as an example
    @example starts @note
        this is a noted example and no need to close the @note tag, it is closing with the closing tag of the example
    @example ends
@section ends

and the same with the @comment tag

for now this is the current version of the typing system witch i will use in textarea, it will be helpfull to create and handle the concept with no need to click a button eatch time the user needs to upload file or creating a new section in his document
